# 🐾 Paws for Effect - Frontend Web Development Project

This website was built in a group of 3 as our final project for our Frontend Web Development module.

We decided to choose a fictional non-profit organisation dedicated to the care, rescue, and adoption of dogs and cats.

## 📌 About the Project

The goal was to design a user-friendly and accessible platform that works smoothly across different devices. Each member
contributed to different aspects, including layout design, bringing that layout to life using HTML, styling using CSS, and making the web page
interactive using JavaScript. We focused on clear navigation, mobile
compatibility, and showcasing adoptable animals to support the shelter’s
mission. Throughout this project, we learned how to effectively build
websites as a team, splitting the work into Design and Scripting.
