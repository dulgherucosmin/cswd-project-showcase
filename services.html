                    <h2>Neutering</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="service-info">
                    <p> Neutering your pet is important for you, your community and your pet as it reduces the amount of unwanted animals appearing in shelters and it may also prevent medical problems from developing in your pet allowing them to live a longer and healthier life.</p>
                    <h3>Benefits of neutering</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Testicular cancer is common in young male dogs with statistics showing up to 27% of male dogs will develop it, neutering your dog will reduce this risk and allow them to possibly live a healthier life.</li>
                        <li>Un-neutered dogs are more likely to get aggressive with other dogs.</li>
                        <li>Neutering can reduce the number of homeless and feral cat populations by reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you find yourself in a situation where your female dog was not neutered and has become pregnant we will take the puppies off your hands when they are old enough to be separated from their mother and find homes for them. We can also neuter the mother once she has been given a health check and is healthy enough to be neutered.</p>
